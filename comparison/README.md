# Simple readme

    as of right now, this is a rough draft of the final product
    I'll standardize the queries to a json format
    For now, just make a list of restaurants and queries
    The system should print the scores it gives each restaurant-query pair
    Contact Nickk on the discord if I missed something or my output is useless
    Alot of the output is to files
